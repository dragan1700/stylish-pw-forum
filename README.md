Custom styles for the ProcessWire forum

To be used with a browser extension like Stylish.
Font "Inter" needs to be installed on the system.
In settings (where should it be used?), use "URL beginning with" https://processwire.com/talk/
This is very hacky, and personal tastes differ.

What does it do?

- Improves legibility (font-sizes, line-heights)
- Smaller main container (max-width)
- Fix avatar image squashing.
- Some (to me) un-needed items hidden (mark all items as read)
- Hover background-color on rows
- Removed zebra styling
- Increased color contrast (a11y)
