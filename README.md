Custom styles for the ProcessWire forum

To be used with a browser extension like Stylish.

Font "Inter" needs to be installed on the system (get it here: https://rsms.me/inter/)
Alternatively, just change the font to whatever you like. 
A similar, and widely-used font is Roboto, which is also freely available.

In your style-browser-extension settings (where should it be used?), use "URL beginning with" https://processwire.com/talk/

What does it do?
- Improves legibility (font-sizes, line-heights)
- Smaller main container (max-width)
- Fix avatar image squashing.
- Some (to me) un-needed items get hidden (mark all items as read)
- Hover background-color on rows
- Removed zebra styling
- Increased color contrast (a11y)

Caveat: This is all very hacky, and - of course - personal tastes differ. Change / adapt to your liking as you wish.
